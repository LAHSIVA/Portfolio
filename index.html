        <h3>Frontend Developer</h3> 
        <p>
          I am a dedicated and skilled computer science student pursuing an Integrated M.Sc. in Theoretical Computer Science at PSG College of Technology. With proficiency in C, C++, Python, JavaScript, R, SQL, and Java, I possess a diverse skill set. I am well-versed in using tools and libraries like Git, Adobe Photoshop, and VS Code. Having a strong interest in Full Stack Development, Data Science, Game Development, and App Development, I have undertaken various projects to enhance my expertise. Notably, I have worked on web development, game creation, and virtual operating systems. An active learner, I have completed an NPTEL course on Machine Learning and continue to expand my knowledge through online courses. I am also an enthusiastic participant in extracurricular activities and have secured recognition in competitions. My dedication and passion make me an aspiring candidate for a summer internship opportunity.

          <h3>Python Development</h3>
          <p>Summary of Python Projects:

            Snake and Ladder Game:
            In this project, I developed a fun and interactive Snake and Ladder Game using the PYGLET library, which is specifically designed for gaming purposes in Python. The game offers both Single Player and Multiplayer modes, showcasing my ability to leverage external libraries and modules to create dynamic gaming experiences.
            
            Hangman-Game:
            The Hangman-Game project is a classic implementation of the popular Hangman game. I created a list of dictionary words as a module and imported it into the main file for word selection. The game provides players with six lives to guess the letters in the word. Correctly guessed letters are made visible, while incorrect guesses lead to a decrease in points. This project demonstrates my understanding of modular programming in Python and my attention to detail in game development.
            
            In both projects, I utilized Python modules, packages, and external libraries to create engaging and interactive applications. These projects showcase my problem-solving skills, creativity, and practical applications of Python in gaming development. They will be valuable additions to my portfolio, highlighting my proficiency in Python development and ability to create entertaining games for users..

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>Summary of Web Development Projects:

            Mondrain Project:
            In this project, I paid tribute to Piet Mondrain by creating web pages inspired by his paintings. Utilizing HTML and CSS, I focused on mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of layout design and responsive web development.
            
            Tin-Dog Project:
            A dynamic web development project showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The webpage adjusted its layout based on the device screen size, offering a seamless user experience. I learned to work with custom components, frameworks, and navigation bars while exploring various features available in Bootstrap 5.
            
            ALL-Flag Project:
            This web development project involved creating flags of different countries, including India, Sweden, Switzerland, Iceland, and Palau, using CSS. I practiced combining CSS selectors and positioning elements to accurately display the flags. It helped me enhance my proficiency in CSS styling and design.
